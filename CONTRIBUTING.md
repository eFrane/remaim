Contributing
============

ReMaIm is an open source, community-driven project. If you'd like to contribute,
feel free to do this, but remember to follow this few simple rules:

Branching strategy
-------------------

- For new features, or bugs base your changes on the `master` branch and open PRs against `master`

Coverage
--------

- All classes that interact solely with the core logic should be covered by Specs
- All features should be covered with .feature descriptions automated with Behat but we realize they're not yet

Code style / Formatting
-----------------------

- All new classes must carry the standard copyright notice docblock
- All code in the `src` folder must follow the PSR-2 standard
