## ReMaIm â€“ Redmine to Maniphest Importer

### Dependencies

You will need to have a copy of Phabricator's libphutil in your path.
We assume that you have installed arcanist via your package manager and that
libphutil sits in /usr/share/libphutil.

If such is not the case, you will have to adapt the path inside lib/Wizard.php

### Installation

```bash
composer install
```

### Usage

**Note**: All tasks and comments will be created by the user whose Phabricator
API key you will be using.

The tool currently also presumes that you have created user accounts for all your collaborators in Phabricator since the Conduit API does not allow to create new accounts.

Users will be looked up by their full names, so make sure your users have the same full names in both Redmine and Phabricator before launching the migration process.


1. Copy remaim.yml-dist to remaim.yml and fill in your redmine and
phabricator credentials
2. php bin/remaim (or ./vendor/bin/remaim)


### Running tests

```bash
./vendor/bin/phpspec run
```
